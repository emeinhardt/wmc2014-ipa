# wmc2014-ipa
A notebook for processing response data from Warner, McQueen & Cutler (2014)'s response data to use Unicode IPA symbols and adding explicit representation of stimuli contexts and prosodic structure.

TODO
 - It looks like Warnet et al. have updated the response data file (now `WarnerMcQueenCutler_raw_data_gates_revised.txt` rather than `diphones-raw-data.csv`) since whenever I first wrote this notebook; the current notebook needs to be run against that.
